    <h1>Changes</h1>
    <p>I only changed the bar and background. All the other things like rounded corners and shadows were already included in coding assignment 2. So if you go with your curser above
    a list item in the bar it has an animation that changes it colors like a rainbow and the text rotates 5 deg and the list item you lengthens. However the
    background is linear gradient from dark blue to light blue. All in all these changes affected all webpages.
