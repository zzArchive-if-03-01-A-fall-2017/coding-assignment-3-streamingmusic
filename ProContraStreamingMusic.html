        <h2 class="text-center">PROS</h2>
        <h3><strong>Unlimited storage</strong></h3>
        <p>The biggest problem with storing digital music on your computer or external drive is the risk of the music library being corrupted, deleted, or mismanaged.</p>
          <p>While iTunes helps users manage their music library, you need to regularly back it up on CDs, DVDs, or to an external drive.</p>
          <p>Only music you buy from the iTunes Music Store gets backed up on your account, where you can re-download it if need be.</p>
          <p>If you want to backup non-iTunes music files, Apple will charge you a fee for storing or accessing it on your account.</p>
        <h3><strong>Access</strong></h3>
        <p>With streaming music sites, your music is accessible to you everywhere you can get Wi-Fi access, and 3G access if you subscribe to a premium service. </p>
        <p>Itâ€™s quite easy to set up almost any computer these days to stream music to wired and Bluetooth speakers, just as you would to an analog stereo.</p>
        <h3><strong>Variety</strong></h3>
        <p>You are able to listen to all the music available on the platform that you are registered on. Therefore you do not have to buy every single song you want to listen to.</p>

        <div class='right-col'>
        <h2 class="text-center">CONS</h2>
        <h3><strong>Internet Connection</strong></h3>
        <p>If you are not connected to the internet you will not be able to listen to your music, unless you have a premium account and are able to download the music.</p>
        <h3><strong>Payment for Artists</strong></h3>
        <p>The artists get paid less than if someone bought a CD.</p>
