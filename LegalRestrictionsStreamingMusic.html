      <strong>Playing Music for Personal Enjoyment</strong>
      <p>As long as you and a few family members or friends are the only ones listening to the music you are playing,
      you do not need a license or permission to play music. It is only when the music you play is heard
      in public that the legal necessity for a license arises.</p>
      <strong>Playing Music in Public</strong>
      <p>The right to perform or play a song in public is one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder.
         You will need to get permission or a license if you play music in public, unless the music is in the
         public domain or the use of the music qualifies as fair use. But the line between what is private and
         what is public is complicated. Prior to the Music Licensing Act in 1998, some court cases have drawn
         the line and declared public uses of music to be copyright infringement, unless licensed as follows:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>-Radio stations, bars, night clubs, and juke box operators</li>
           <li>-Hotels that play the radio for guests through speakers or headphones</li>
           <li>-Restaurants</li>
           <li>-Shops</li>
           <li>-Telephone systems that play music while callers are on hold</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Also the size, the type of public establishment and the stereo equipment which is used, play a role.
           Restaurants and bars under 3750 square feet are exempt from paying for playing radio or TV for their customers.

      <h3>Composition</h3>
      <p>For musicians who write or compose music, the copyright laws work automatically to protect their work.
       The musician may also use his or her music in any way for education. Use of original music by the composer
       is free from all copyright and license issues. However before sending copies of their work
       to recording labels, the artist should consider registering their music first in order to avoid the
       question of who wrote the song first. </p>

      <h3>Plagiarism and Fair Use</h3>
      <p>Composing a song that is similar to another one is plagiarism and can therefore also be copyright
      infringement. In contrast to that, parodies can be a special fair use case.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Music Sampling</h3>
      <p>Sampling can not be done without permission or a licence because of the copyright on the sound recording.</p>
