    <h1>History of Streaming Music</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>January 1993</h2>
      <h3>Internet Unnderground Music Archive</h3>
        <p>Internet Underground Music Archive (IUMA) launched as the first free online music archive of MP3 downloadable songs.
          It allowed unsigned musicians to share music, communicate with their audience, and distribute their music to fans while
          avoiding record labels. Because unsigned artists were looking more for exposure rather than sales, this free online archive
          was a great method of marketing their music.

      <h3>last.fm</h3>
      <p>Last.fm launched as a platform that uses a music recommender to build a detailed profile of each userâ€™s musical taste after
        recording details of the tracks they listen to. The site offers numerous social features and can recommend artists similar to the
        user's favorites. This technology that analyzes music taste precedes many of the future music recommending algorithms on
        current streaming services.

      <h3>Pandora</h3>
      <p>Pandora Radio launched as a rebranding effort for Music Genome Project with the goal of using algorithms and a complex song
         sorting program to create personalized radio stations based on listener's preferences. It was one of the early glimpses into
         the "freemium model," where users can listen for free with ads or pay $10 per month for uninterrupted streaming.

      <h2>October 2008</h2>
      <h3>Spotify</h3>
      <p>Spotify was launched to tackle the issues of music piracy, offering a seemingly infinite, catalog of music for audiences to
        listen to. Rather than getting paid per download, artists receive part of a royalty payment each time their song is
        streamed. Spotify's business model relies on driving revenue from
        1) advertisements played on Spotify's free version, and
        2) subscription fees incurred to access Spotify's ad-free Premium service.
