        <p>Most internet music players work in a similar way: the user chooses a musician or a song and then the site begins streaming the song's data to your device.</p>
        <p>The following explains the technology behind popular music streaming services like <a href="www.spotify-com">Spotify</a>.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>Services like Spotify and Soundcloud rely on a peer-to-peer <strong>(P2P)</strong> network.</p>
        <p>When the user selects a song, Spotify's computers immediately begin sending the data to your computer.
           At the same time, it looks for other Spotify users who have the song on their computers.
         When it finds the track, it sends bits of the song to your computer.</p>
         <br>
         <h2>Tricks</h2>
         <p>Another trick these music streaming services use is caching (storing) the songs the user listens to right on their hard drive.
         That means, that their computer plays the song. The size of the cache is set by default to <strong>10 GB</strong>, but users can adjust its size.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Spotify is very clever. The site knows that most of its users listen to albums from the beginning to the end. So if you start playing the first song of an album,
            Spotify begins preloading subsequent tracks too, so that you never experience playback delays.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>Format and Speed</h2>
         <p>All songs are in the <strong>Vorbis</strong> format. That means that this format is compressed to transfer the files more easily.</p>
         <p>Most songs stream at <em>160 kbps</em> (kilobits per second), although Premius users can stream at a higher-quality 320kbps.</p>
